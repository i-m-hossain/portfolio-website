Md Imran ,Hossain,,Dhaka,Jan 15,Software Engineer | Javascript | React  | Nodejs  | Laravel | Java,"Being a software Engineer, I am very enthusiastic about solving problems. I think programming languages are the tools that we use to solve those problems. I love to dive deep and have enormous interests in learning different aspects of SDLC including system design, development, testing and deployment. I am a hustler and I believe every day is a new opportunity to learn and grow and go a step ahead from the previous day.  I have worked with different technologies like Node.js, Laravel, React, Svelte, MongoDB, MySQL, Bash script, Python and Java etc. Over the years, I have worked with Agile methodology, Standard coding practice, Project management tools, and Version control systems.   I have completed my graduation from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. I see myself as a professional individual who is very passionate about helping others and contributing to the organizations I am working with.",Software Development,9203,"Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh",[imran1409036],"[PORTFOLIO:https://mdimranhossain.netlify.app,OTHER:https://github.com/i-m-hossain]",
